100m and hurdles have people starting at the same line. Other races stagger participants.
Two kinds of finishes: (a) Chest finish (b) Shoulder stretch (Pivoting their shoulders forward to get one over the line). 
Track number assignment works based on heat times. The top four heat times get the four middle tracks. 
Most WRs are made by athletes in middle tracks.

The starter thingy is called a set of starting blocks. 200m races have staggered starting positions because of the curved track. The curves are wide on the edge, and sharp on the inside, so the middle tracks are the best. 

Hurdles: 110m for men and 100m for women. 10 hurdles in the women's race. 13m to the first hurdle, 8.5m between middle hurdles, and 10.5m for the last hurdle. 

The 400m race has 10 hurdles as well. Every distance has 10 hurdles in a hurdles race. In a 400m race, the first hurdle is 45m next 35m each and the last is 40m. The hurdle position has official names for the leg that sticks out in the jump: "the leading leg", and the other one: "the rear leg". Making a hurdle fall with your leading leg is a foul and making it fall with your rear leg isn't. 

4x100m relay: The batons are exchanged with the person passing it on extending at the middle of the track or something.
